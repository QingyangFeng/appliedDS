For set up mongodb first go to the main page download mongodb

for the mac user:
first extract the file

tar -zxvf mongodb-osx-ssl-x86_64-3.6.3.tgz

Copy the extracted folder to the location from which MongoDB will run

mkdir -p mongodb
cp -R -n mongodb-osx-ssl-x86_64-3.6.3/ mongodb

Then enter the following sentence into the .bash_profile or .bashrc

export PATH=<mongodb-install-directory>/bin:$PATH

ps. you can find the .bash_profile by running ls -a on the default path when you open a new terminal (Basically is in here cd /User/you account user name/)

after that you need to set up the default path for data storage
sudo mkdir -p  /data/db

or do it seperately
sudo mkdir /data
cd  /data
mkdir data

then you can run the mongodb by entering 

mongod
ps. if you set the db file in a specific place you will need to run mongod --dbpath  <the location of the data/db file>
and open another terminal entering

mongo


for windows user:
Just foller the step like the normal install
but the default path for /data/db file is in the C:// on the windows

here is the guide for windows and linux user  https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/

some basic guide for mongo db
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mongodb/index.htm

for pymongo（mongodb api） :
here is the link of guide
https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/tutorial.html

run following command to install pymongo which is a python package to link the mongo db and you 
pip instll pymongo

we need to import MongoClient from pymongo
from pymongo import MongoClient

# The MongoDB connection info. This assumes your database name is TwitterStream, and your collection name is tweets.
 client = MongoClient()
 db = client.TwitterStream
 collection = db.tweet

 after finish to set up the things you want to save just run
 collection.save(tweet)
 to save the tweet into the database.

ps. you need to creat the db and collection first before you running the code.

for the sample you also need to install a package called tweepy 
pip install tweepy
