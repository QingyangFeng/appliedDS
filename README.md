# Applied-Data-Science


## Marking Criteria

Please find below a list of quality criteria for the ADS projects that we will be using for marking. Use these as guidance when writing your reports. 

- introduce the problem and setting, explaining why it's worth exploring.

- give a clear statement of aims and objectives.

- unambiguously describe and fully justify the design choices of the system and the assumptions underlying it.

- describe and motivate the methods used (mathematical/computational/experimental/...).

- give full details of the system, with all necessary detail to reproduce it.

- describe the results clearly and comprehensibly, using appropriate diagrams/graphs/charts, properly labelled and captioned.

- insightfully interpret the results, and their meaning and significance in the context of the original problem and what is already known.

- give sensible conclusions and future lines.

- have a clear link with the data science pipeline throughout.

Remember that the project counts for 90 marks. The remaining 10 marks are be given to the presentations. These will consist of a 10 min talk on April 23rd, followed by questions from the audience. The goal of the talks is for you to present an overall high-level description of your projects. All groups will get feedback on their presentations by Monday the week after.
