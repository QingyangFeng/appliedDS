The features can be separated by two main blocks:
  - your profile
  - global information
  
Your profile involves:
  - Get recommendations
  - Top Influencers on your profile
  - Tweet density retweets by week

Global Information:
  - Evolution of a topic (by hashtag): number of tweets per month, day, etc. Optional: Predict evolution of the topic
  - Visualization of a topic on a map. Evolution like a network. See this http://helenjacksonanalytic.co.uk/EW_prop_price.html

For the Model I could not make much research, but recommendations can be based on these features: tweet topic, followers, number of retweets of a topic.
